Final Project Process Documentary

### Rutvi Gupta / Dec 16th 2018

### Background: My thesis is working with a community of dependent spouses to help protect their work authorizations, which the current administration is threatening to revoke. Because this is a complex issue, surrounded by the complexities of our immigration system and even gender bias, many people are unaware of the details of this communities situation and experience. 

### Purpose:
To use data to create an accessible way for people to understand the current situation of dependent spouses, including who would be affected if work authorizations are taken away, the backlog of the immigration system which makes getting a greencard nearly impossible (hence limiting dependent spouses to legally work) and to show how dependent spouses are contributing to society.
