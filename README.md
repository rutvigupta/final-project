Final Project Process Documentary

### Rutvi Gupta / Dec 16th 2018

### Background: 
My thesis is working with a community of dependent spouses to help protect their work authorizations, which the current administration is threatening to revoke. Because this is a complex issue, surrounded by the complexities of our immigration system and even gender bias, many people are unaware of the details of this communities situation and experience. 

### Purpose:
To use data to create an accessible way for people to understand the current situation of dependent spouses, including who would be affected if work authorizations are taken away, the backlog of the immigration system which makes getting a greencard nearly impossible (hence limiting dependent spouses to legally work) and to show how dependent spouses are contributing to society. 


## My Process: 

### Data Collection
A large part of my project was actually spent in finding compelling and authentic data that would help me achieve my purpose. I spent several hours on the USCIS (U.S Citizenship & Immigration Services) website trying to comb through their various data reports, and had to do secondary research to understand what certain terms in the immigration system meant. 

Though USCIS was my primary source of data for two of the visualizations, for the other visualization I also combed through an advocacy group's website, which over the course of the past 3 years has been collecting stories from hundreds of dependent spouses. I used this to synthesize various occupations from individual stories, as well as Twitter.

I also received (seemingly compelling) statistics from some women from the community of dependent spouses, but after digging into the sources and finding differing statistics as well as no trace of the original source, I decided visualizing that data felt unethical and decided against it. 

### Selecting a Concept
I saw a great opportunity to combine one of my thesis goals with this final project, and began thinking of ways to present data in an accessible and personal way. Taking major inspiration from Georgia Lupi and her Dear Data Project, I realized postcards could be a wonderful medium to work with. 

Some challenges were the actual size of the postcard, which limited how I could begin to envision my visualizations and also the fact that the visualizations would be static. 


### Visualizing
I began by sketching on paper, to better understand what the different ways were that I could use to present the data I had. I also began looking up different types of visualizations by combing through the Data Viz Catalogue and the Data Viz Project. This really helped me gain more vocabulary on the different types of visualizations I could gain inspiration from and also assess the tradeoffs in choosing a particular style. 

For example, one direction I considered going in was visualizing wait times that dependent spouses went through before they were allowed to work, and began visualizing it in a radial diagram but realized ultimately, it was extremely hard to read.  


### Final Reflections, Challenges, Next Steps
1. Data visualizations are data first, aesthetics second. I think for some of my visualizations I was paying more attention to the design than to preserving the integrity of the data which set me up with less effective visualizations. 

2. Something I really struggled with was understanding the balance between a visualization being "too simple" vs "too complicated". According to me, my visualizations skew extremely simple, however I would love to do more usability testing to understand if they are still effective in their intention. 

3. This project really made me more aware of tracing the sources of data, and what "good" data means. Should I trust data simply because it comes from a Govt website? What if there are different reports that tell different stories? Should I trust statistics in articles, when different articles show discrepancies? I don't really have answers to these questions, but I am now far more wary of what I find, and will definitely incorporate a practice of ethics and healthy skepticism going forward. 

4. I really struggled with the word cloud visualization primarily because I realized my data was not only qualitative, but it also only had one dimension - making visualizing it extremely difficult. I chose to include it mostly because of the synthesis process that was involved in creating it, however I am aware that as a visualization, it is not very effective. 

4. Next steps: I think having some sort of digital presence for this project could be extremely useful to scale it out. Even a platform that allows users to input their own postcards that have been personalized could become an interesting data collection of its own, that could be visualized. I will be actually testing these postcards out by mailing a set to women across the country, and I'm very excited to learn more about the conversations that come out of it!
